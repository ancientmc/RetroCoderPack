## Ancient Coder Pack ##

See the How-To text file (HOWTO.md) to get started with ACP.


**What is the Ancient Coder Pack?**

The Ancient Coder Pack (ACP) aims to create a buildable gradle that allows users to view decompile source
code from older Minecraft versions. Currently, the only version being worked on is Alpha 1.2.6. It is inspired
by the Mod Coder Pack (MCP), a now-defunct tool that allowed users to view Minecraft's source code for mod development.
This project hopes to do the same and encourage mod-development for older MC versions, and generally act as an educational
tool for people to learn about the history of Minecraft.

**What tools are used for ACP?**

Check the "docs/credits/" folder for information regarding the tools ACP uses and their respective credits.


**What mappings does ACP use?**

ACP uses MCP names and SRG files. The SRG file for Minecraft Alpha 1.2.6 is generated via a tool developed by AncientMC called [SRGConfig](https://github.com/moist-mason/SRGConfig). 
SRGConfig aims to convert the original RGS files found in the earliest MCP versions, albeit slightly modified, 
and converts them into SRG files, with custom names and everything. The mappings are taken from numerous MCP versions, written by the original MCP devs. 
Take a look at the SRGConfig repository for more information.
